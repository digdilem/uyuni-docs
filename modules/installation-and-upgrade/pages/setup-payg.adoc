[[set.up.payg.instances]]
= Set up {payg}

In the three major public cloud providers (AWS, GCP and Azure), SUSE:

* provides customized Pay-as-you-go-specific product images (eg. SLES, SLES for SAP...)
* operates per-region RMT Servers mirroring repositories for products available as {payg}

{payg} instances are registered to the closest RMT Server at launch time (region/Server name is auto-determined)


This document describes how to set up {payg} instance to {productname} server, and what happens in case instance is no longer available or accessible.


//OM: It is also possible to set up PAYG using XML RPC, but we don't have that procedure desribed yet


== Setting up {payg} 

[[proc-setting-up-new-payg]]
.Procedure: Setting up new {payg}  instance
[role=procedure]
. In the [guimenu]``Admin > Setup Wizard > {payg}`` click btn:[{payg}].
. In the new screen, click btn:[Create] to add new {payg} connection data
. In the menu:Add new {payg} data[Description], add the description of the newly created connecton.
. In the menu:Add new {payg} data[Hostname], enter the actual name of the instance as it appears on the Cloud.
. In the menu:Add new {payg} data[Port], enter 22.
. In the menu:Add new {payg} data[Username], add the actual username as specified in the Cloud (Ricardo?)
. In the menu:Add new {payg} data[Password], enter... (Ricardo?)
. In the menu:Add new {payg} data[Key], add the correct instance key
. In the menu:Add new {payg} data[Key Password], add ... (Ricardo?)

[IMPORTANT]
====
Authentication keys must always be in PEM format.
====

If you are not connecting directly to the Cloud, but via SSH bastion, proceed with <<proc-adding-ssh-bastion-connection-data>>.

Otherwise, continue with <<proc-finishing-payg-setting-up>>.

[[proc-adding-ssh-bastion-connection-data]]
.Procedure: Adding SSH bastion connection data
[role=procedure]
. In the menu:Add new {payg} data[Bastion Hostame], add the bastion hostname
. In the menu:Add new {payg} data[Bastion Port], add the bastion port number
. In the menu:Add new {payg} data[Bastion Username], add bastion the username
. In the menu:Add new {payg} data[Bastion Password], add bastion password
. In the menu:Add new {payg} data[Bastion Key], add bastion key
. In the menu:Add new {payg} data[Bastion Key Password], add bastion key passoword

Complete the setup process with with <<proc-finishing-payg-setting-up>>.

[[proc-finishing-payg-setting-up]]
.Procedure: Finishing {payg} setting up
[role=procedure]
. Click btn:[Create].
. You will return to [guimenu]``Admin > Setup Wizard > Pay-as-you-go`` screen.
. If all of the entered authentication data for the instance are correct, the column Status will soon show "Credentials succesfully updated".

[IMPORTANT]
====
If the invalid data are entered at any point, the newly created instance will be shown in Setup Wizard > PAYG, with the status displaying Error message.
====


As soon as the authentication data is available on the server, a list of available products is updated.
Available products are all versions of the same product family and architecture as the one installed in the {payg} instance. 
[guimenu]``Admin > Setup Wizard > Products`` screen shows a full family of products that are associated with the new instance. 

Once the products are shown as available, they need to be scheduled for syncing synced by selcting the checkbox next to the product name and then btn:[Add product].
For more information how to add products for syncing, see... existing OLD link here....


To see the progress of channel syncing in GUI, go to [guimenu]``Software > Channel List > All`` to find that the new channel has been added to the list. 
To monitor the syncing progress in the log files, go to /var/log/rhn/reposync directory on (Ricardo - which server?)



The following procedure describes how to delete the instance.

[[proc-deleting-payg-instances]]
.Procedure: Deleting PAYG instances
[role=procedure]
. Go to [guimenu]``Admin > Setup Wizard > {payg}``
. Find the instance you want manage on the list of existing instances
. Click on the instance details
. Select btn:[Delete] and confirm your selection.
. You will be returned to the list of instances and the one that was just deleted will no longer be shown.



== Status refreshing  

Instance status is refreshed every 10 minutes and is shown in the column Status (...or else WHERE too).

{payg} instances remain registered on {productname} server regardless of their status on the Cloud. << CHECK with Ricardo
The connection is refreshed by taskomatic and always uses the last known authentication credentials to acces the instance.
When the instance is not reachable, the reposync will fail.


There are a number of reasons why instance may not be accessible from the {productname}.

. If the instance exists, but is stopped, the last known credentials will be used to try to connect to that instance. 
    The availability of these credentials will vary depending on the cloud provider.

. If the instance no longer exists, but is still registered with SUMA, the authantification will fail.
    The error message is shown in the column status. 
    (The level of detail the error message displays varies << RICARDO, let's check this?)

[WARNING]
====
The error message shown to the user only indicates that the instance is not available. 
Further diagnostics about the status of the instance needs to be done on the Cloud.
